We currently do not have an external test environment or developer accounts in production. If you don't want to use your live production account to test, the easiest thing to do is to create a new Sellbrite account just for testing. Every new account has full access to the API for 30 days, and that time can be extended by our [support team](mailto:support@sellbrite.com), if necessary.
