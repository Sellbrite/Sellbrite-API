Clients who use the Sellbrite API are subjected to two rate limits:

* The maximum number of API calls per minute is 40 API requests.
* The maximum number of API calls per second is 2 API requests.

If your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned with this body:

`Rate Limit Exceeded`
